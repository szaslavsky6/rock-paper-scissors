# rock-paper-scissors
Rock Paper Scissors game I completed for The Odin Project.

The Rock Paper Scissors game was done with javaScript. This project allowed me to utilize the skills I've learned so far through The Odin Project. Some of those
    skills include problem solving, creating functions, and utilizing loops.
